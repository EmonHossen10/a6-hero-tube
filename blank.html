        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold  my-3">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const </h2>
        <li>The var keyword was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with var have
            function scope. This means that they can be accessed from anywhere within the function where they are
            declared, even if they are declared later in the function.</li>
        <li>
            The let keyword was introduced in ES6. Variables declared with let have block scope. This means that they
            can only be accessed from within the block of code where they are declared.
        </li>
        <li>
            The const keyword was also introduced in ES6. Variables declared with const are constants. They cannot be
            changed after they are declared. const variables also have block scope.
        </li>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold  my-3">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
        <li>To represent the absence of a value. For example, if you are trying to access the value of a variable that
            has not been assigned a value, the value will be undefined.</li>
        <li>To represent an empty object. The value null can be assigned to a variable to indicate that the variable
            does not contain an object.</li>
        <li>To check for the absence of a value. You can use the === operator to check if a variable is equal to null or
            undefined.</li>
        <li>To avoid errors. If you are not sure if a variable has been assigned a value, it is better to assign it the
            value null to avoid errors.</li>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold  my-3">What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
        <li>Resource identification: Every resource in a REST API must be uniquely identifiable by a URI (Uniform
            Resource Identifier).</li>
        <li>Resource manipulation through representations: The state of a resource can be manipulated by transferring
            representations of that resource.</li>
        <li>Self-descriptiveness: The meaning of a resource and its actions should be understandable from the URI alone.
        </li>
        <li>Uniform interface: All resources in a REST API should be accessed using the same set of operations.</li>
        <li>Stateless: A REST API should be stateless, meaning that each request should be independent of any previous
            requests.</li>
